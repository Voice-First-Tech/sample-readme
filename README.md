# Purpose of Repo (Start With Why)
start with a story of the end customer experience...
John works hard all day. After he returns home from the office he walks through the front door and announces "Alexa, pop some popcorn" to prepare a bag of tasty treats. Alexa declares the bag is ready before John plops down on the couch. "Alexa, turn on the TV to Orange is the New Black". Oh no... not another pesky door-to-door salesman. Luckily, Jim uses the {Project-Name} to keep annoyances such as these out of his life. Now Jim can enjoy his tasty treats and watch his favorite shows in peace.
